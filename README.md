# 🌩️ Cloud Computing Preparation – Personal Roadmap & Projects

👋 Hi, I’m @fgatto13  
🌱 I’m currently revisiting and deepening my knowledge in core Computer Science topics as part of my preparation for a career in **Cloud Computing**, with the long-term goal of working as a **Cloud Architect**, particularly in **enterprise-level (B2B) infrastructures**.

While I have side interests in areas like **web development**, **human-computer interaction**, and **computer graphics**, my current focus is on building a robust and practical understanding of the technologies and systems that underpin modern cloud platforms.  

> ⚠️ This roadmap is **not a learning curve mapping**, but a **portfolio-focused recap** of the foundational knowledge I’ve already acquired through academic study and personal projects. It is structured to consolidate and apply this knowledge through targeted projects.
