# 👋 Hi, I'm @fgatto13 — a Curious and Driven CS Graduate

🎓 I'm a Bachelor’s graduate in Computer Science with a broad set of interests across the tech landscape. From full stack web development to embedded systems, network infrastructure, distributed systems, and even the ever-evolving world of ML/AI — I’m passionate about understanding how complex systems work from the ground up.

🌩️ My long-term goal is to build impactful systems in the **Cloud Computing** space. That said, I'm always open to exciting opportunities that let me grow, solve real-world problems, and learn new things along the way.

## 🛠️ What I'm Working On

### 🔹 Python Learning Journey
I'm currently dedicating most of my time to learning **Python**, with a focus on:
- Solid OOP fundamentals
- Working with databases and APIs
- Working on full-scale projects
  
Check out my structured Python learning repo:  
📘 [Python_fromScratch](https://github.com/fgatto13/Python_fromScratch) – Theory + Practice, all in one place.

### 💻 Projects live now!
These are a bunch of projects that I have done to reinforce my knowledge in Python, other than because I wanted to!

- 👾 [PythonPkmnFinder](https://github.com/fgatto13/PythonPkmnFinder) - A simple yet fun Pokémon app, emulates a Pokédex using PyQt5, allowing you to search for any mon via [PokeAPI](http://pokeapi.co/).
- 🏎️ [PythonF1Analytics](https://github.com/fgatto13/PythonF1Analytics) - F1 data analytics tool built using Python and the [OpenF1](https://openf1.org) API. Currently working on it!
- 🕰️ [PythonDigitalClock](https://github.com/fgatto13/PythonDigitalClock) - My first full Python project, a PyQt5 digital clock with custom fonts, logging, error handling and macOS packaging.
- 🌤️ [PythonWeatherApp](https://github.com/fgatto13/PythonWeatherApp) - The classic of the classics, a PyQt5 Weather app made using [OpenWeatherAPI](https://openweathermap.org/). Features light and dark mode, too!

### 🔹 Past University Projects (ReactJS + Spring Boot)

Even though these were part of university coursework, they reflect my early experience with full stack and frontend design:

- 🌐 [MetaClass](https://github.com/fgatto13/MetaClass): A full stack platform using **ReactJS** (frontend) and **Spring Boot** (backend) for managing university lectures and collaboration.
- 🎨 [CulturEase_HCI](https://github.com/fgatto13/CulturEase_HCI): A human-computer interaction prototype for a cultural content app, focused on **user experience and UI design**.

> These projects are currently deprecated, but still represent my earlier explorations into frontend/backend development and HCI.
